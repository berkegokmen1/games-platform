# A simple yet powerful game platform.
Simple web app with great features.
Built for learning purposes.

## Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Express] - Fast node.js network app framework
* [ejs] - HTML templates done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Bootstrap] - Great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - Evented I/O for the backend
* [Bootswatch] - Great sketchy theme for bootsrap
* [Passport] - Simple, unobtrusive authentication for Node.js
* [socketio] - Great sketchy theme for bootsrap
* [jQuery]

And of course this project itself is open source with a [public repository][repo] on GitHub.
